# 🌌 Spacetime Visualizer

An interactive visualization tool that demonstrates how massive objects bend spacetime, inspired by Einstein’s General Relativity. Users can place objects like planets, stars, and black holes on a spacetime grid and see how curvature forms around them in real-time.

## 🚀 Features
- **Interactive Grid:** 2D/3D spacetime grid with zoom and rotation.
- **Drag & Drop Objects:** Add planets, stars, black holes, or custom masses onto the grid.
- **Realistic Curvature:** Visual bending of spacetime based on object mass.
- **Multiple Objects:** Combine effects to see how different masses interact.
- **Mass Slider:** Adjust object mass dynamically to deepen or reduce curvature.
- **Light Paths (Geodesics):** Toggle to visualize how light bends around massive objects.
- **Educational Overlay:** Optional explanations of General Relativity principles.
- **Dark Mode:** A glowing, smooth-rendering grid with animations.

## 🎮 Controls
- **Drag & Drop:** Place objects on the spacetime grid.
- **Rotate View:** Click + drag the mouse to orbit the camera.
- **Zoom:** Scroll or pinch to zoom in and out.
- **Adjust Mass:** Use sliders to modify the mass of each object in real-time.
- **Reset:** Clear all placed objects and reset the grid.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Three.js / WebGL** → for rendering 3D interactive spacetime curvature.
- **JavaScript / TypeScript** → app logic and UI controls.
- **Shaders** → for realistic curvature and light-bending effects.
- **HTML + CSS** → for the user interface.

## 📖 How It Works
- The grid represents spacetime fabric.  
- When a massive object is placed, the program calculates curvature based on its mass.  
- Curvature is visualized as a depression or distortion in the grid.  
- Light paths are traced along geodesics to show gravitational lensing.
